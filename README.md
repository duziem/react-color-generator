# React Color Generator

This Project generates a computed RGB color set based on the Red, Green, Blue values entered by a user and then applies the computed RGB set as a style to a div to display the result

## Components

`Red Input Field`
`Green Input Field`
`Blue Input Field`
`Resultant div` - displays the resultant RGB color set

The App throws an error whenever a non-digit is entered in the input fields. When an error is thrown subsequent values entered by a user will not be computed unless the source of the error is cleared
